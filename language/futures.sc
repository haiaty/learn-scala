/**
* ----------------------------------------------
* Futures
* -----------------------------------------------

  - Futures let you write concurrent programs without as great a risk of deadlocks and race conditions
  - futures are asynchronous transformations of immutable state
  - Future allows you to specify transformations on Future results and obtain a new future that represents the composition of the two asynchronous computations: example Map, flat Map
  - One advantage of Scala's futures is that they help you avoid blocking.  By avoiding blocking, you can keep the finite number of threads you decide to work with busy
  - it lets you simplify your code and take advantage of multiple processors.
